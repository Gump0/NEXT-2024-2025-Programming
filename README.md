This year's challenge was to make a game revolved around the theme of mini-putt. Contestants were given a development API based on open source libraries designed to build games for Windows using C++.

For gameplay footage checkout this [YouTube video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGatTi-meg0)

## Running the game

On Windows, open **Game.sln** in Visual Studio 2022 and hit **F5**.

That's it!

Might include support for others in the future.
